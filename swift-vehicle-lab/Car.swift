//Write a designated initializer that takes six arguments total, the three arguments for the superclass's initializer (name, weight, and maxSpeed), and three arguments for these new properties (transmission, cylinders, and milesPerGallon). The initializer should set all three new properties to their associated arguments, and call the superclass's initializer, passing it the correct arguments that it requires.
